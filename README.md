# MQTTonLogiCAD
MQTT communication sample code written in Structured Text for LogiCAD3

PLC / SPS used is a Revolution Pi core 3+ running the trial license of LogiCAD3
The MQTT function blocks from the standard library are implemented here. Structured Text is an  IEC 61131-3 standard programming language often used for industrial purposes. Sample code for a lot of functionality is still lacking on the internet and I am uploading what I figured out.
